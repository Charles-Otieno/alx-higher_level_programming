## Tasks

### 0. cURL body size

Write a Bash script that takes a URL as input, sends a request to that URL using cURL, and displays the size of the response body in bytes.

### 1. cURL to the end

Write a Bash script that takes a URL as input, sends a GET request to the URL using cURL, and displays the body of the response.

### 2. cURL Method

Write a Bash script that sends a DELETE request to a URL passed as the first argument and displays the body of the response.

### 3. cURL only methods

Write a Bash script that takes a URL as input and displays all HTTP methods the server will accept.

### 4. cURL headers

Write a Bash script that takes a URL as input, sends a GET request to the URL using cURL, and displays the body of the response. The request must include a header variable `X-School-User-Id` with the value `98`.

### 5. cURL POST parameters

Write a Bash script that takes a URL as input, sends a POST request to the URL using cURL, and displays the body of the response. The request must include two variables: `email` with the value `test@gmail.com` and `subject` with the value `I will always be here for PLD`.

### 6. Find a peak

Write a Python function that finds a peak in a list of unsorted integers. The function must not import any modules and must have the lowest possible complexity.

### 7. Only status code

Write a Bash script that sends a request to a URL passed as an argument and displays only the status code of the response.

### 8. cURL a JSON file

Write a Bash script that sends a JSON POST request to a URL passed as the first argument and displays the body of the response. The request must include the contents of a file passed as the second argument.

### 9. Catch me if you can!

Write a Bash script that makes a request to `0.0.0.0:5000/catch_me` that causes the server to respond with a message containing `You got me!` in the body of the response.
